Alien invasion is a light twist on space invaders where you play as an alien trying to blow up enough asteroids to build the super duper laser, and win the game.

Use left and right arrows to move, space to shoot, 1-5 to purchase upgrades, and x to quit.

To run the program, put the asteroid_attack folder to the desired folder, and open a console window. In that console window type 

cd desired folder path

then type 

python asteroid_attack/core.py

For example, when I leave the file in my downloads, I type.
cd Downloads
python asteroid_attack/core.py

Now I'm playing the game. If it tells you that a png cannot be found, then you cd'd into the wrong location.
